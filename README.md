# Smiling dentist manager
*Smiling dentist manager* it's an open source management for dentist studios. 
It's born by listening the needs of [Dental Smile](linkedin.com/company/dental-smile-srls) studio, and how they needs a mangement software.
I thinked to myself, I have the opportunity to do a great Java Open Source software that solve a real-life problem, 
because I will have a continuos feedback (whatelse the software needs to have, bugs, etc ...) and at least one company will use my software (that's great).  
So I tell them, I can do it! But it will be Open Source, and here we are!

## Description
This software is composed by two clients and one server:  
- The [first client](https://github.com/OrlandoParente/smilingDentistManager/tree/main/smilingDentinstManagerClient) is a desktop application written with Swing. In future probably I will re-writing it with Java FX.  
  To date I *do not* raccomend to use this client, cause it miss some functionalities.
- The [second client](https://github.com/OrlandoParente/smilingDentistManager/tree/main/SmilingDentistManagerServer/src/main/resources) is directly integrated in the server and it's a web application gui written with bootstrap.
- The [server](https://github.com/OrlandoParente/smilingDentistManager/tree/main/SmilingDentistManagerServer) is an MVC application written with SpringBoot. It has API Controllers  
  - [API Controllers](https://github.com/OrlandoParente/smilingDentistManager/tree/main/SmilingDentistManagerServer/src/main/java/sdms/controller/api), for a generic use of the server. You can build your own client and use this as a server throught this API.
  - [Web Controllers](https://github.com/OrlandoParente/smilingDentistManager/tree/main/SmilingDentistManagerServer/src/main/java/sdms/controller/web), that are controller dedicated to the client directly integrated with it
 
## Why you should use my application
If you want to use this application you should keep in mind, as written in the licence, I have no liability for any damage derivated by the use of this software.  

On other hand, in my option, there are a couple of reason for use this software:
- *It's Open Source*, that's mean:
   - You, or anyelse for you, can check the code for be sure there is nothing weird;
   - You, or anyelse for you can edit it for adapt to your own needs (add functionalities, change colors, add languages, etc ...)
- *Choose your cost*, namely:
   - Even though you can keep smilingDentistManager for free, you need to upload it somewhere for make it works properly (I mean, it's a server after all). But for sure, you can choose the best solution for you both in terms of *costs* and *resources allocated*
